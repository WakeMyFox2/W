IT 233 QUESTIONS (Computer Organization)
========================================

Question 1: What is a register? Provide an example.
---------------------------------------------------

A register is a small, permanent storage location within the CPU that serves a specific purpose. These storage units are built directly into the processor and can hold data, addresses, or instructions temporarily while the CPU processes them. Registers are measured in bits or bytes rather than megabytes like regular memory, making them extremely fast to access.

Registers function as a scratchpad for the currently executing program, holding intermediate results or data values that need to be accessed quickly. They are manipulated directly by the Control Unit and are wired for specific functions within the processor architecture.

Example: The Program Counter (PC) register, also called the instruction pointer, is a special-purpose register that keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. When a program runs, the PC continuously updates to point to the next instruction in sequence, ensuring the program flows correctly from one step to the next.


Question 2: Explain the types of RAM.
--------------------------------------

RAM (Random Access Memory) comes in several types, each with distinct characteristics:

DRAM (Dynamic RAM) is the most common type found in computers today. It's relatively inexpensive, consumes less electrical power, generates less heat, and takes up less physical space compared to other RAM types. However, DRAM is volatile, meaning it loses all stored data when power is turned off. Additionally, it must be continuously refreshed—recharged with power thousands of times each second—to maintain the data it holds.

SRAM (Static RAM) offers faster performance than DRAM and is typically used in applications where speed is critical, such as CPU cache memory. While it's also volatile and loses data without power, SRAM doesn't require constant refreshing like DRAM. The trade-offs are that it's more expensive and takes up more space than DRAM, which is why it's used more sparingly in computer systems.


Question 3: Explain the computer components in Von Neumann architecture.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Von Neumann architecture, proposed in 1945 and still serving as the standard for modern computers, consists of several key components working together:

Memory serves as the primary storage where both program instructions and data reside. This implementation of the "stored program concept" allows the computer to treat programs and data uniformly, storing both in the same memory space that is addressed linearly.

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) contains three main subcomponents. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) handles all arithmetic calculations and Boolean logical operations. The Control Unit (CU) manages the fetch-execute cycle, accessing program instructions and issuing commands to the ALU while also moving data between CPU registers and other hardware components. The Interface Unit facilitates communication between the CPU and external components.

Registers are small storage locations within the CPU that hold data needed quickly or frequently, storing information about the CPU's status and the currently executing program.

Input/Output (I/O) devices allow the computer to interact with the external world, including keyboards, mice, scanners for input, and monitors, printers for output.

These components work together through a bus system that interconnects them, allowing data and instructions to flow between different parts of the computer.


Question 4: What is the control unit and what does it do?
----------------------------------------------------------

The control unit is a crucial component within the CPU that orchestrates the execution of program instructions. It serves as the conductor of the computer system, coordinating all processing activities.

The control unit performs the fetch-execute cycle, which is the fundamental operation of any computer. During this cycle, it retrieves program instructions from memory and manages their execution. Specifically, it accesses program instructions and issues the necessary commands to the ALU to perform required operations.

Additionally, the control unit moves data between CPU registers and other hardware components, ensuring that information flows to where it's needed. It controls the processing of instructions and manages the movement of data within the CPU itself. The control unit decodes each instruction—determining what operation needs to be performed—then signals the appropriate components to carry out that operation.

Through these coordinated activities, the control unit ensures that programs execute correctly and that all computer components work together harmoniously.

Question 5: Explain the TCP/IP model.
--------------------------------------

The TCP/IP model is a fundamental networking framework that defines how data is transmitted across networks, particularly the Internet. While the course materials focus on networking concepts more broadly, TCP/IP operates as a protocol suite that enables different computers and devices to communicate effectively.

The model organizes network communication into distinct layers, each handling specific aspects of data transmission. These layers work together to ensure reliable delivery of information from one computer to another across complex networks. Each layer has defined responsibilities and communicates with the layers directly above and below it.

In practice, TCP/IP protocols provide the common ground rules that allow diverse systems—regardless of their hardware or operating system—to exchange data reliably. This standardization is what makes the Internet possible, allowing billions of devices worldwide to communicate seamlessly. The protocol suite handles everything from breaking data into manageable packets to ensuring those packets reach their destination correctly and in the proper order.


Question 6: What is a client/server network?
---------------------------------------------

A client/server network is an architecture where computing tasks are distributed between two types of systems: clients and servers, each playing distinct roles.

In this model, a client is a computer or program that requests services or resources. When you use your computer to access a website, check email, or retrieve files from a network, your machine is acting as a client. Clients initiate communication by sending requests for specific services they need.

A server is a computer or program designed to respond to these requests by providing services, resources, or data. Servers are typically more powerful machines configured to handle multiple simultaneous requests from many different clients. They store data, host applications, manage network resources, and perform processing tasks on behalf of clients.

The relationship works through a request-response pattern: the client sends a request over the network, the server processes that request and performs the necessary operations, then sends back a response with the requested information or confirmation that the task was completed. This architecture is fundamental to how most modern networks operate, from small business networks to the entire Internet.


Question 7: Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption are two fundamentally different approaches to securing data.

Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption operations. When someone wants to send an encrypted message, they use this key to scramble the data. The recipient then uses the exact same key to unscramble and read the message. This is also called shared key encryption because both parties must possess the same secret key. The main challenge with symmetric encryption is securely distributing this key to all parties who need it, since anyone who obtains the key can decrypt all messages.

Asymmetric encryption solves the key distribution problem by using a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be freely shared with anyone and is used to encrypt messages. The private key is kept secret by its owner and is the only key that can decrypt messages encrypted with the corresponding public key. This approach is particularly useful for secure communication between parties who have never met or established a shared secret beforehand. When someone wants to send you a secure message, they encrypt it using your public key, and only you can decrypt it using your private key.

The key difference is that symmetric encryption uses one key for both operations and is generally faster, while asymmetric encryption uses two different keys and provides better security for key distribution but requires more computational resources.


Question 8: What are the database models?
------------------------------------------

Based on the course materials, databases can be organized according to different conceptual models that determine how data is structured, stored, and accessed. While the specific technical details of traditional database models weren't extensively covered in the provided materials, several important concepts emerge.

Database systems are essential for storing and managing information in business applications. They support transaction processing systems by maintaining data that must always be correct and up-to-date. Modern databases serve as foundations for business operations, allowing organizations to perform database maintenance, generate documents and reports, and process inquiries from users.

The materials reference object-oriented approaches to data management, where information is organized around objects—discrete entities that a programmer wants to manage or manipulate. Object-oriented systems support concepts like inheritance (the ability to inherit properties from higher-order objects), modularity (interlinked yet standalone components), and encapsulation (concealing properties inside objects).

Contemporary database discussions also include distributed ledgers and blockchain technology, which represent newer approaches to data storage. These systems maintain synchronized copies of data across distributed networks with different participants, offering alternatives to traditional centralized database architectures.

The choice of database model depends on the specific needs of the application, including factors like the complexity of data relationships, query requirements, scalability needs, and whether data needs to be centralized or distributed across multiple locations.

really curious about the problem selected and highly motivated by the problem's importance. 
Consider a specific
problem/opportunity in the topic area at this moment in time and think about how the implementation 
of the digital
technologies you learned in this course can solve the problem in the next ten years. You may 
extrapolate how you think the
current technologies might evolve in the next ten years and apply that to your solution. Creative 
solutions are allowed and
encouraged. Make sure to apply at least two of the digital technologies that you learned in this 
course and consider the
ethical, societal, and business issues highlighted throughout the course.

Note that by selecting one topic area you are not necessarily eliminating the other topic areas. In 
fact, the specific problem
you select may relate to several topic areas. As you develop your project, make sure you reference

• Chapter 12 , Introduction to Information Systems


I. IS Development

• Applying the Systems Approach to IS development

• The Systems Approach is a systematic way to develop a

solution to a problem


II. The Systems Approach

• Uses a systems orientation to defining and solving problems and opportunities

• Problem Solving – there are specific steps in solving any problem

• Recognize/Define a Problem or Opportunity – recognize it exists

• Develop and Evaluate Alternative System Solutions – what are the different ways to solve this

problem?

• Select the Best System Solution – decide which alternative is best

• Design the Selected System Solution – design the system for the chosen solution

• Implement and Evaluate the Success of the Designed System – put the solution into effect and

monitor results for the outcome


II. The Systems Approach

• Systems Thinking – the “Fifth Discipline” – seeing the

system context

• See the Interrelationships among the systems rather than linear

cause-and-effect chains

• See the Process of change among the systems rather than discrete

‘snapshots’ of change


II. The Systems Approach

• Systems Thinking


III. Systems Analysis and Design

• The process of designing and implementing an IS – Object-

oriented or Life Cycle approaches

• The Systems Development Life Cycle – a multistep,
iterative process to designing systems, very popular, 5
Phases: Investigation, Analysis, Design, Implementation,
Maintenance


IV. Starting the Systems Development Process

• Systems development can be very costly, investigations are made to determine whether

to proceed

• Feasibility Studies – identify needs, resources, costs, benefits

• Operational Feasibility – will the proposed system fit existing business environment and

objectives?

• Technical Feasibility – degree to which current technical resources can be applied to the

new system

• Human Factors Feasibility – assess the degree of approval/resistance to the new system


IV. Starting the Systems Development Process

• The Systems Development

Life Cycle


IV. Starting the Systems Development Process

• Feasibility Factors


V. Systems Analysis

• A detailed study of the current system and organizational needs

• Organizational Analysis – you must have a thorough understanding of the organization to

make the system work well

• Analysis of the Present System – “those who fail to study history are doomed to repeat it”, a

complete understanding of the current system is critical

• Logical Analysis – create logical models the current system, WHAT the system does without

regard to HOW

• Functional Requirements Analysis and Determination – what Information is required for

each business activity and what Processing is required in the system


VI. Systems Design

• Create a new system to solve the problem/opportunity

• Prototyping – create working models of the proposed system

• The Prototyping Process – prototypes are developed quickly for trial by

users to obtain user feedback

• User Interface Design – critical because the interface is the part of the

systems closest to the user

• System Specifications – listing of elements that formalize the design


VI. Systems Design

• The Prototyping Process


VII. End-User Development

• IS professionals act as consultants while user do their own

application development

• Focus on IS Activities – focus should be on fundamental activities:

input, processing, output, storage, control

• Doing End-User Development – may discover new or improved

ways to do the job


VII. End-User Development


VII. Technical Note: Overview of Object- Oriented

Analysis and Design

• Objects – anything a programmer wants to manage or manipulate

• Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

• Inheritance – ability to inherit properties of a higher-order object

• Modularity – a series of interlinked yet stand-alone modules

• Polymorphism – different behavior based on conditions

• Encapsulation – concealing all the properties inside the object

• Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) – modeling the problem domain as an object-

oriented system

• Object-Oriented Design (OOD) – create solutions using objects


I. The World of Systems Implementation

• Implementation  is  a  vital  step  that  must  be  completed;  it  is

important to PLAN an implementation.


II. Implementing New Systems

• May be difficult and time-consuming

• The Implementation Process


III. Project Management

• What Is a Project? – a set of activities with a beginning and an end, has

goals and tasks, may have constraints (limitations)

• The Process of Project Management – five phases:

• Initiation and Defining – state the problem and identify objectives and resources,

explore costs/benefits

• Planning – identify and sequence objectives/activities

• Executing – put plans into motion

• Controlling – ensure project objectives and deadlines are met

• Closing – install deliverables, release resources, end the project


III. Project Management

• Phases of Project Management


IV. Evaluating Hardware, Software, and  Services

• Performance must be demonstrated and evaluated

• Hardware Evaluation Factors – physical and performance

characteristics

• Software Evaluation Factors – similar to evaluating hardware

• Evaluating IS Services – services may be provided by suppliers of
hardware/software or by third parties; do the services address your
needs?


IV. Evaluating Hardware, Software, and  Services


IV. Evaluating Hardware, Software, and  Services


IV. Evaluating Hardware, Software, and  Services


V. Other Implementation Activities

• Testing – testing and debugging are important, does the system

work as it should?

• Data Conversion – new implementations often require replacing

software and databases

• Documentation – an important means of communication, often

overlooked

• Training – training users is vital, usually under-budgeted, and

expensive


V. Other Implementation Activities

• System Conversion Strategies – cutting over to the new system

• Direct – simplest but most dangerous method, turn off the old system and turn on the new

one

• Parallel – most expensive but safest, run both systems until everyone is satisfied, then

turn off old system

• Pilot – let only a select few users use the new system until they are happy, then implement

the new system for everyone; best user representation can be selected for the trials

• Phased (Modular) – gradual conversion one module at a time, combines best of both

direct and modular while minimizing risks


V. Other Implementation Activities

• System Conversion Strategies


V. Other Implementation Activities

• Postimplementation Activities – Use and Maintenance – the longest and most costly phase of a
system’s life; correct errors, improve performance, adapt to changes in the business
environment

• Systems Maintenance – making changes to the system

• Corrective – fix errors

• Adaptive – adding new functionality

• Perfective – improve performance

• Preventative – reduce chances of future system failure

• Postimplementation Review – ensure the new system meets established business objectives

Background on Moore's Law

• Moore’s Law 1965

• The number of transistors on a chip will double every 18-24 months;
more broadly interpreted – the power or speed of a computer will double
every 18-24 months

• The price would halve in that same time, which has also proven to be true

• Recent statistics indicate this time has decreased to 12 months


Background on Moore's Law

• Consequences

• The rate of processor speed increases seems to be slowing

• Solution

• Multi-core CPUs

• An integrated circuit with two or more processors connected to it for faster simultaneous
processing of several tasks, reduced power consumption, and for greater performance.


Background on Moore's Law

• Emerging  technology  is  no  longer  just  about  making  faster

processors, but about:

• Small chips

• Energy efficient chips

• Specialized chips (e.g., graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing
units (TPUs), quantum processors)

• Using  processors  for  more  intelligent/sophisticated  applications  (e.g.  novel
algorithms in learning).


Future of Transportation Systems

and Smart Cities

will the way we travel, work, and live change as a result?


Smart Cities

• Smart cities put data and digital technology to work to make better decisions and improve
the quality of life.

• Three layers work together to make a smart city

1.  Technology base, which includes a critical mass of smartphones and sensors connected by 
high-speed
communication networks.

2.  Smart applications. Translating raw data into alerts, insight, and action requires the right 
tools, and
this is where technology providers and app developers come in.

3.  Adoption and usage by cities, companies, and the public. Many applications succeed only if they 
are

widely adopted and manage to change behavior.


Smart Cities

2.  Development  of  multiple  vaccines  to  COVID-19  in  less  than  a  year
(vaccines typically take at least a decade to develop).

•  These vaccines have allowed us to achieve an unprecedented level of overall

immunity.


Future of Medicine

3. DeepMind

• a Google owned AI research company claimed to have solved the 50-year-old
"grand challenge" of accurately predicting the structure that proteins will fold
into.

• DeepMind's program, called AlphaFold was able to determining a protein's 3D

shape from its amino-acid sequence.

• Proteins are the building blocks of life, responsible for most of what happens inside
cells. How a protein works and what it does is determined by its 3D shape.


Future of Medicine

4- CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) - an approaches to
genome editing.

• Genome editing - a group of technologies that give scientists the ability to change an
organism's DNA. These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or
altered at particular locations in the genome.

• Genome editing can help in the prevention and treatment of human diseases.

• Major use cases

•Genetic disorder treatment

•Drug discovery

• The future of medicine will have even more profound impacts on our daily lives.

devices such as Google Glass-type "smart glasses“.

• Examples, comparing prices online, checking the reviews of a restaurant before going
in, etc.

• privacy concerns

• Lack of privacy regulations

• Users' data rights and ownership

• Example,  imagine  if  personal  details  from  people's  social  media  profiles  were
immediately visible as digital overlays while walking down the street, just based on
facial recognition or near-field communication between people's mobile devices or
AR/VR headsets.


Discussion


Transportation Questions

•  Think of a recent journey you have made where you faced a delay. What transportation system(s) 
did you use?
List the information you had about this journey and reflect on the information others (the 
transportation system
provider, the transportation vehicle(s), the infrastructure provider, the infrastructure itself, 
etc.) had related to
your journey and how visible this information was to other parties. How did the lack of visibility 
of information
contribute to the delay you faced? How could improved visibility of information across the 
different parties
enable a safe and timely journey for you?

•  What do you think are the biggest problems with the transportation system today? How do you see 
those
being solved? What will transportation systems look like in 10, 20, or 30 years? How will the way 
we travel,
work and live change as a result?

•  As 5G will help autonomous vehicles talk to each other much more effectively in the future, what 
do you think
this kind of change could bring to cities and drivers?

•  What do you think are the biggest challenges to reaching the future of transportation systems 
and smart cities?


Medicine Questions

•  Think of a medical situation you experienced in your family or in your circle of friends. How 
easy was the
access to the latest medical knowledge and procedures? How could access be better / faster / easier 
/ more
complete and how would it improve the medical situation? What barriers make your envisioned improved
scenario difficult?

•  How does DeepMind's breakthrough affect our understanding of diseases and drug discovery? What 
are the
implications of this solution for the future?

•  What do you see as major obstacles of AI/ML implementation in healthcare? Choose three obstacles 
from the
five listed and explain why you think they are the most important: (1) data security, (2) lack of 
formalized
medical knowledge, (3) gaps in policies governing medical data, (4) mindset of patients, and (5) 
mindset of
doctors.

•  What do you see as the first major applications of CRISPR, and when do you think that will 
happen? What are
the major regulatory and ethical barriers for further CRISPR development?


Conclusion

• As has been the case for the past few decades, digital innovation will be the

driving force behind the most significant changes in our society.

• These changes will affect every industry and facet of life, from how we
communicate, to how we experience our surroundings, to how we interact
with healthcare, work, manufacturing, etc.

• Along  with  these  technological  developments  come  serious  ethical  and
policy  questions,  and  answering  those  will  fundamentally  shape  these
emerging technologies and how they are deployed.

What is technology innovation?


Technology Innovation

• Innovation

• Adding extra steps of developing new services and products that fulfill unaddressed needs or
solve problems that were not in the past.

• Technology Innovation

• Focus on the technological aspects of a product or service rather than covering the entire

organization business model.

• Part of successful innovation processes include generating a wide variety of ideas and expanding
the solution space beyond the obvious.


Brainstorming

• Brainstorming is one technique for identifying numerous solutions to a given problem in a
short time frame.

• Brainstorming rules

• Defer judgment – separating idea generation from idea selection.

• Encourage wild ideas – breakout ideas are right next to the absurd ones

• Build on the ideas of others – listen and add to the flow of ideas

• Go for volume – best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas

• One conversation at a time – maintain momentum as a group. Save the side conversations for later.

• Headline – capture the essence quickly and move on. Don't stall the group by going into a 
long-winded
idea


How to set up a brainstorming session

• Recruit the best people

• Watch out for groups larger than 8 people.

• Involve people with different areas of expertise and who you know to be good brainstormers.

• Set the stage

• Bring toys and props - related and unrelated to your brainstorm. Props can give you something to
play with and can jog your thinking in unexpected directions.

• Be mindful of seating and layout – not too far apart and facing each other.

• Pick a space where there's lots of writing space on the walls.

• Bring lots of paper and markers –encourage everyone to use them.

• Review the rules and ask group to self enforce them


Activity: 101 Uses


Activity: 101 Uses

• Instructions

• Form a group of 3-4 students,

• Discuss study questions 10 -15 minutes

• Group leader can share ideas/ results of the discussion


Activity: 101 Uses

• 101 Uses is an activity to think outside the box and share your ideas with your team.

• In small groups, each group should come up with 101 uses for old magazines (or unused
cardboard boxes, or outdated computer materials). Brainstorm as many ideas as possible
within ten minutes.

• Share  your  insights  from  the  activity.  The  teams  need  every  conceivable  idea  their
classmates can offer to approach the target number. There is value in building on each
other's ideas and not inhibiting ideas from others.


Need finding and Empathy


Design Thinking

• What is design thinking?

• A method to focus the design and development decisions of a product on the needs of the customer,
typically involving an empathy-driven process to define complex problems and create solutions that
address those Problems.


Design Thinking Process

Empathize

• Empathy is the centerpiece of a human-centered design process. The Empathize mode is
the work you do to understand people, within the context of your design challenge. It is
your effort to understand the way they do things and why, their physical and emotional
needs, how they think about world, and what is meaningful to them.

• Why empathize?

• The problems you are trying to solve are of a particular group of people; in order to design for 
them, you
must gain empathy for who they are and what is important to them.


How to Empathize ?

• Observe - observe users and their behavior in the context of their lives. Some of the most 
powerful
realizations come from noticing a disconnect between what someone says and what he does.

• Engage - Also called ‘interviewing'. Prepare some questions to ask, but expect to let the
conversation deviate from them. Elicit stories from the people you talk to, and always ask “Why?”
to uncover deeper meaning. Engagement can come through both short ‘intercept' encounters and
longer scheduled conversations.

• Watch and Listen - Combine observation and engagement. Ask someone to show you how they
complete a task. Have them physically go through the steps, and talk you through why they are
doing what they do. Ask them to vocalize what's going through their mind as they perform a task or
interact with an object.


Define

• The goal of this stage is to craft a meaningful and actionable problem statement – which is 
called a
point-of-view (POV). This should be a guiding statement that focuses on insights and needs of a
particular user, or composite character. Insights emerge from a process of synthesizing information 
to
discover connections and patterns.

• Why define?

• An endeavor to synthesize your scattered findings into powerful insights.

• Synthesis of your empathy work that gives you the advantage that no one else has.

• Discoveries that you can leverage to tackle the design challenge.


How to Define ?

• Develop an understanding of the type of person you are designing for – your USER.

• Synthesize and select a limited set of NEEDS that you think are important to fulfill.

• Work to express INSIGHTS you developed through the synthesis of information your have gathered 
through

empathy and research work.

• Articulate a point-of-view by combining these three elements – user, need, and insight – as a 
problem
statement.

• A good point-of-view is one that:

• Provides focus and frames the problem

• Inspires your team

• Informs criteria for evaluating competing ideas

• Empowers your team to make decisions independently in parallel

• Captures the hearts and minds of people you meet


Ideate

• The concentration on idea generation. Mentally it represents a process of “going wide” in terms of
concepts and outcomes. Ideation provides both the fuel and also the source material for building
prototypes and getting innovative solutions into the hands of your users.

• Why Ideate?

• To transition from identifying problems to creating solutions for your users.

• Various forms of ideation are leveraged to:

• Step beyond obvious solutions and thus increase the innovation potential of your solution set

• Harness the collective perspectives and strengths of your teams

• Uncover unexpected areas of exploration

• Create fluency (volume) and flexibility (variety) in your innovation options

• Get obvious solutions out of your heads, and drive your team beyond them


How to Ideate ?

• By  combining  your  conscious  and  unconscious  mind,  and  rational  thoughts  with
imagination.

• Theme: Separating the generation of ideas from the evaluation of ideas.

• Ideation techniques:

• Brainstorming

• Bodystorming

• Mind mapping

• Sketching


Prototype

• The iterative generation of artifacts intended to answer questions that get you closer to your 
final solution.

• Low-resolution prototypes — quick and cheap, but can elicit useful feedback

• Why Prototype?

• To ideate and problem-solve. Build to think.

• To communicate. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand pictures.

•  To start a conversation . Your interactions with users are often richer when centered around a 
conversation piece. A

prototype is an opportunity to have another, directed conversation with a user.

• To fail quickly and cheaply . Committing as few resources as possible to each idea means less 
time and money invested
up front.

•  To test possibilities . Staying low-res allows you to pursue many different ideas without 
committing to a direction too
early on.

• To manage the solution-building process . Identifying a variable also encourages you to break a 
large problem down

into smaller, testable chunks.


How to Prototype ?

• Start building. Even if you aren't sure what you're doing, the act of picking up some
materials (post-its, tape, and found objects are a good way to start!) will be enough to get
you going.

• Don’t spend too long on one prototype . Let go before you find yourself getting too
emotionally attached to any one prototype.

• ID a variable. Identify what's being tested with each prototype. A prototype should answer

a particular question when tested.

• Build with the user in mind . What do you hope to test with the user? What sorts of
behavior do you expect?


Test

• Solicit feedback, about the prototypes you have created, from your users and have another

opportunity to gain empathy for the people you are designing for.

• Testing is another opportunity to understand your user, but unlike your initial empathy

mode, you have now likely done more framing of the problem and created prototypes to test.

• Why Test?

• To refine prototypes and solutions . Informs the next iterations of prototypes.

• To learn more about your user . often yields unexpected insights.

• To refine your POV. Sometimes reveals that not only did you not get the solution right, but also

that you failed to frame the problem correctly.


How to Test ?

• Show don’t tell. Put your prototype in the user's hands – or your user within an experience.

• Don't explain everything.

• Let your tester interpret the prototype.

• Watch how they use what you have given them, and how they handle and interact with it

• Listen to what they say about it, and the questions they have.

• Create Experiences. Create your prototypes and test them in a way that feels like an
experience that your user is reacting to.

• Ask users to compare . Bringing multiple prototypes to the field to test gives users a basis
for comparison.


Prototyping and Experimentation


Experience Prototyping

• Any kind of representation, in any medium, that is designed to understand, explore
or communicate what it might be like to engage with the product, space or system
we are designing.

• Methods that allow designers, clients or users to "experience it themselves“ rather

than witnessing a demonstration or someone else's experience.

• For example, it demands that the designer think about the experience of light rather than think
directly about the design of the physical lamps themselves


Experience Prototyping In Practice

• Advantages of Experience Prototyping

• Understanding existing user experiences and context

• Exploring and evaluating design ideas

• Communicating ideas to an audience


Experience Prototyping In Practice

• Understanding existing user experiences and context

• Goal — to achieve a high-fidelity simulation of an existing experience which can't be
experienced directly because it is unsafe, unavailable, too expensive, etc.

• Questions to ask in this stage:

• What are the contextual, physical, temporal, sensory, social and cognitive factors we must

consider as we embark on design?

• What is the essence of the existing user experience?

• What are essential factors that our design should preserve?


Experience Prototyping In Practice

• Exploring and evaluating design ideas

• Goal — facilitating the exploration of possible solutions and directing the design team
towards a more informed development of the user experience and the tangible
components which create it.

• Experience is already focused on specific artifacts, elements, or functions to evaluate a
variety of ideas .


Experience Prototyping In Practice

• Communicating ideas to an audience

• Goal — to let a client, a design colleague or a user understand the subjective value of a
design idea by directly experiencing it.

•  This is usually done with the intention of persuading the audience — for example, that
an idea is compelling or that a chosen design direction is incorrect.


Identifying Viable Business Opportunities

• An idea is not necessarily a viable business opportunity.

• A business opportunity is an idea that has the potential to become a viable
enterprise, with a place in one or more markets.

• It comes from recognizing a problem and making a deliberate attempt to solve that
problem.


Identifying Viable Business Opportunities

• For an idea to be worth pursuing, we must first determine whether the idea translates

into a business opportunity.

• Methods for finding new business opportunities

• Develop a new market for an existing product.

• Find a new supply of resources that would enable the entrepreneur to produce the

product for less money.

• Use existing technology to produce an old product in a new way.

• Use an existing technology to produce a new product.

• Use new technology to produce a new product.


Conclusion

• The creative mindset and particular practices enable innovation and
entrepreneurship.

• Try to create and implement an innovative and entrepreneurial mindset throughout
the course.

• Question: If you could change one answer to the study questions you already
completed for this week, what would you change?

Discussion - Study Questions

● Think of a situation where you wish you had better insight about the past or future. What data 
would
enable the generation of such insights? How feasible is it to pull the required data together? 
E.g., reflect
on the insights you wish you had about the delay in your journey from Module 1.

● How will our day-to-day lives be changed by big data? How will this trend transform  our lives 5, 
10,
and 15 years in the future?

● What excites you the most about the big data revolution?

● What concerns you the most when it comes to big data?

● How might the importance of big data affect domestic or international politics?


What is Big Data?


Big Data

• Big Data

• The exponential explosion in the amount of data being generated in this increasingly digital age.

•  Importance of Big Data

• Big data can be analyzed for insights that improve decisions and give confidence for making 
strategic
business moves.

• When you combine big data with high-performance analytics, you can accomplish business-related
tasks such as: determining root causes of failures, issues and defects in near-real time, 
recalculating
entire risk portfolios in minutes, detecting fraudulent behavior before it affects your 
organization.


Big Data

Big data sources

• Streaming data comes from the Internet of Things (IoT) and other connected devices that flow
into IT systems from wearables, smart cars, medical devices, industrial equipment and more. You
can analyze this big data as it arrives, deciding which data to keep or not keep, and which needs
further analysis.

• Social media data stems from interactions on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc. This includes
vast amounts of big data in the form of images, videos, voice, text and sound-useful for marketing,
sales and support functions. This data is often in unstructured or semistructured forms, so it 
poses a
unique challenge for consumption and analysis.


Big Data

Big data sources

• Publicly available data comes from massive amounts of open data sources like the
US government's data.gov, the CIA World Factbook or the European Union Open
Data Portal.

• Other big data may come from data lakes, cloud data sources, suppliers and
customers.


History of Big Data

The concept of big data gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst
Doug Laney articulated the now-mainstream definition of big data as the three V’s:
Volume, Velocity and Variety .

• Volume  -  Organizations  collect  data  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including
transactions, smart (IoT) devices, industrial equipment, videos, images, audio, social
media  and more. In the past, storing all that data would have been too costly – but
cheaper storage using data lakes, Hadoop and the cloud have eased the burden.


History of Big Data

• Velocity - With the growth in the Internet of Things, data streams into businesses at
an unprecedented speed and must be handled in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors
and smart meters are driving the need to deal with these torrents of data in near-real
time.

• Variety -  Data comes in all types of formats – from structured, numeric data in
traditional databases to unstructured text documents, emails, videos, audios, stock
ticker data and financial transactions.


Impact on Individuals


Impact on Individuals

• How our day-to-day lives may be changed by big data?

• How this trend may transform our lives 5, 10, and 15 years in the future?

• Examples :

• Self driving cars.

• Smart cities.

• Accessibility to big data Impact on our lives

• Anyone has access to models like GPT-3 that are trained on massive-scale data sets.


Impact on Businesses


Impact on Businesses

Main ways in which businesses can leverage big data to their advantage

• Informing Business Decisions - With data, you can better understand what's happening in the
business and the wider market and predict what might happen in the future – information that's
critical to good decision-making. Therefore, across every business function, data can and should be
used to make smarter business decisions.

• Better Understanding Customers and Trends -  Sales and marketing activity is often based on past
sales  history  –  effectively.  Companies  are  now  confidently  and  accurately  anticipating  
what
customers will want in the future.

• Example: Netflix predicting what you might want to watch next.


Impact on Businesses

Main ways in which businesses can leverage big data to their advantage

• Delivering More Intelligent Products and Services - When you know more about your customers,
you can give them exactly what they want: smarter products and services that respond intelligently 
to
their needs.

• Improving Internal Operations- Every business process and every aspect of business operations can
be streamlined and enhanced. Optimizing pricing, reducing employee turnover, boosting productivity,
strengthening the supply chain – across all areas of the business, it's easier than ever to make
improvements, generate efficiencies, save money, automate processes, and more.


Impact on Businesses

Main ways in which businesses can leverage big data to their advantage

• Creating Additional Revenue- Optimizing business processes, making better business decisions,
and so on, will have a positive impact on the bottom line. data can be monetized to create new
revenue streams. Data can even increase the value of a company; the world's top three most valuable
brands were Google, Apple, and Amazon – each of them data-driven businesses.


Discussion - Study Questions

• Consider how big data sets can power new AI based classification

systems.

• Instructions

• Form a group of 3-4 students,

• Discuss study question – 5 minutes

• Group leader can share ideas/ results of the discussion

•


Discussion - Study Questions

You need to select one of the following use cases:

• Object recognition in driverless cars

• Traffic monitoring and congestion detection

• Detection of cancer cells in pathology slides

• Face recognition in security

• Land use mapping


Opportunities and Challenges


Opportunities

•  Big data technologies can derive value from large datasets in ways that were
previously impossible indeed, big data can generate insights that researchers didn‘t
even think to seek.

• However, the technical capabilities of big data have reached a level of sophistication
and  pervasiveness  that  demands  consideration  of  how  best  to  balance  the
opportunities afforded by big data against the social and ethical questions these
technologies raise.


Opportunities

• New business and investment opportunities can be created by big data

• Predictive analytical solutions can help grow your business in different domains such as Churn
Prediction, Smart recommendations, Pricing personalization, Financial Risk forecasting ,
Demand Forecasting and Customer segmentation.

How to Prepare for This Trend

• Improving data literacy across the organization

• Ensuring access to data, and educating those across the business on how to get the most out of 
data.


Opportunities

• Creating a data strategy

• Helps you remain focused on the data that matters most to your business.

• Good data strategy covers the following points:

•  Business needs – what is your business trying to achieve, and how can data help you achieve 
those strategic objectives

•  Data requirements - What data do you need to achieve your goals and where will that data come 
from?

•  Data governance - considerations such as data quality, data security, privacy, ethics, and 
transparency

•  Technology requirements - hardware and software needs for collecting data, storing and 
organizing data, analyzing data,
and communicating insights from data.

• Skills and capacity - Do you have the skills to deliver your data needs?


Challenges

• Technology - do you have to have the budget ?

• Skills - know-how of?

• Infrastructure


Risks of Big Data


Risks of Big Data

Data privacy

• Protect data from attack, particularly when it comes to personal data (like customer or
employee data).

• data leakage, which threatens privacy. - Advances like the IoT add an extra
dimension to the threat, since many connected devices are totally unsecured, thereby
providing a potential way in for hackers.


Risks of Big Data

Data security

• Protecting data from theft, corruption, or unauthorized access.

• It's not enough to protect your data securely – you need to take an ethical approach to
collecting and using that data. This means being completely transparent, making
customers and other stakeholders aware of what data you're gathering and why, and
giving them the chance to opt out where possible.


Global Implications


Global Implications

The challenge of regulation that internet technologies move fast while government
processes are slow, especially if the action sought requires an agreement or treaty
among nations also afflicts legislation. As a result, there is always the risk that by the
time a regulation is enacted, it will be obsolete, or worse, counterproductive.


Global Implications

In this context, data localization, which explicitly aims to limit flows across borders
by requiring companies to store and process data within national borders, could be
seen as a non-tariff barrier, reducing efficiency by increasing costs and decreasing
scale—effects that spill over into the entire global supply chain.

In recent years, infringements of intellectual property rights have surged, mainly
because digital technology makes counterfeiting and its distribution cheap, relatively
easy, and hard to trace.


Conclusion

• To understand Big Data, its nature, definitions, rapid growth rate, volume,, risks and

security.

• Along with these fundamental concepts, Opportunities, and Challenges are also
highlighted.

• Question: If you could change one answer to the study questions you already
completed for this week, what would you change?

Cybersecurity Definition

Cybersecurity  is  a  company's  ability  to  avoid  the  increasing  threat  from

cybercrime, such as cyberattacks or data theft.

Cyber resilience is a company's ability to mitigate damage and carry on once

systems or data have been compromised.

• A report by IBM found the average cost of a breach to an organization in which personal data

was stolen is $3.86 million – equating to a cost of around $148 per stolen record.


Cyberattacks

Malicious code

• Undesired or unauthorized software that is placed on a target computer to disrupt operations or 
to redirect system

resources for the attacker's benefit.

Malware

• Malicious code designed to gain unauthorized access to, make unauthorized use of, or damage 
computer systems

and networks.

• Types of malware

1.  Virus: A piece of malicious code that spreads from one computer to another by attaching itself 
to other files

through a process of self-replication.

2.  Trojan horses: Hides itself on an infected system and can cause damage to a system or give an 
attacker a
platform for monitoring and/or controlling a system.

3. Worm: Spreads from computer to computer without attaching itself to different files.


Types of Cyberattacks

Deepfake Attacks

• New technique involves using “deepfake” AI technology

• Synthesizes the voices of senior leaders within an organization and then make faked phone calls 
authorizing
the release of data or even hard cash.

Ransomware

•  Attackers encrypt personal or business files and then demand a ransom to unlock them, usually to 
be paid in
anonymous cryptocurrency

Social Media Hacks

• Taking control of the user's social media and email accounts.

•  Using simple social engineering methods, such as tricking authorized users into revealing their 
login
credentials.


Types of Cyberattacks

Software Attacks

Any attack that targets software resources, including operating systems,
applications, services, protocols, and files.

Password Attacks

• Any attack where the attacker tries to gain unauthorized access to and use
of passwords.

• Guessing and cracking.

• Can be found in audit logs.

Cryptographic Attacks

• A software attack that exploits weaknesses in cryptographic system

elements, such as code, ciphers, protocols, and key-management systems.


Types of Cryptographic Attack

Cryptographic Attack Type    Description


Known plaintext attack (KPA)

♦ Attacker has a plaintext message and its corresponding ciphertext.

♦ Attacker tries to derive the correlation between them to determine the encryption key.

♦ Attacker encrypts a selected plaintext message.


Chosen plaintext attack

♦ Attacker analyzes the resulting ciphertext to crack the cipher.

♦ Attacker uses attack results to iteratively repeat the attack for an adaptive chosen plaintext
attack.


Ciphertext-only attack

♦ Attacker has access to ciphertext.

♦ Attacker tries to use frequency analysis or other methods to break the cipher.


Chosen ciphertext attack

♦ Attacker analyzes a selected ciphertext message and tries to find the matching plaintext.

♦ Attacker uses the attack results to iteratively repeat the attack for an adaptive chosen 
ciphertext

attack.


Attacks Mitigations


Cryptography

• The science of hiding information, most commonly by encoding and decoding a

secret code used to send messages.


• Based on mathematics and computer science.

• Protects data in transit and data at rest.

End-to-End Encryption

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a method of secure communication that prevents
third parties from accessing data while it's transferred from one end system or device
to another.

• The data is encrypted on the sender's system or device, and only the intended recipient can
decrypt it. As it travels to its destination, the message cannot be read or tampered with by an
internet service provider (ISP), application service provider, hacker or any other entity or 
service.


Encryption and Decryption


Encryption

A security technique that converts data from plaintext form into coded (or
ciphertext) form so that only authorized parties with the necessary decryption
information can decode and read the data.


Plaintext

Unencrypted data that is meant to be encrypted before transmission, or the result
of decrypting encrypted data.

Ciphertext     Encoded, unreadable data.

Decryption      A cryptographic technique that converts ciphertext to plaintext.

Cleartext       Unencrypted, readable data that is not meant to be encrypted.


Encryption and Decryption

Key

• A specific piece of information that is used in conjunction with an algorithm to perform 
encryption

and decryption.

• Different keys produce different ciphertext.

• For each algorithm, longer keys provide stronger encryption.

• Static and ephemeral keys.

Encryption and Decryption

Types of Encryption

• Symmetric encryption - A two-way encryption scheme in which encryption and decryption are  both

performed by the same key (shared key encryption).

• Asymmetric Encryption - A two-way encryption scheme that uses paired  public and private keys.

• Private key - the component of asymmetric encryption that is kept secret  by one party during two-
way encryption.

• Public key - the component of asymmetric encryption that can be accessed by anyone.

• Key generation - the process of producing a public and private key pair  by using a specific
application.

Hashing

• Hashing -  A process or function that transforms plaintext to ciphertext  that cannot be directly

decrypted.

• Hash, hash value, or message digest -  The value that results from hashing.

• Used in several password authentication schemes.

• Used in digital signatures.

• Used for verifying file integrity.

Encryption/Decryption and hashing

• Encryption and hashing Goals

• Confidentiality

• Integrity

• Non-repudiation

• Authentication

• Access control


How Is Cybersecurity used in Practice?

• Problem

• The May 2019 Baltimore ransomware attack, where municipal computer systems were taken down by 
hackers who
demanded around $72,000 in cryptocurrency to restore access. Even more recently, 23 local 
government agencies in the state
of Texas were taken offline by a similar attack.4 These attacks brought into sharp focus the fact 
that compromising essential
services can put human lives at risk, and contingency plans are essential in order to provide 
resilience.

• Solution

•  Projects exist such as the No More Ransomware initiative – a collaboration between 36 national 
law enforcement agencies
across the globe, which has so far saved 200,000 victims from having to pay out a combined $108 
million5 – and familiarity
with these resources can assist in building resilience. By using this pooled expertise on 
decrypting files, organizations are
able to continue to access their data and carry out their work.


Key Challenges

• Careless or unwary individuals installing unsafe software or clicking a dangerous
email link.

• Not running the latest and updated version of all the key tools (including the
operating systems)

• Human error


Activity: Class Debate on Cybersecurity


Part 1: Introduce the Debate Topic and Assign Sides

• Introduce the debate topic:

• Topic 1: Should end-to-end encryption be banned or restricted by governments?

• Topic 2: Should technology companies be allowed to see your data (e.g., Dropbox checking
whether files you store are illegal; or Apple checking whether your iPhone contains illegal
materials)?

• Then, group students into teams. There are two sides to any debate, and as such,
assign half of the student teams to the affirmative side (“Affirmative Group”) and
the other half to the negative side (“Negative Group”).


Part 2: Student Teams Research Issue

• 25 minutes to research the issue being debated. During the research time, make sure to prepare 
statements to
present their case to the audience. Additionally, in anticipation of the rebuttal, they should 
discuss points the
opposition could make and decide how to refute them.

• Topic 1: Should end-to-end encryption be banned or restricted by governments?

•  Privacy is for paedophiles, UK government seems to be saying while spending￡500k demonising 
online chat encryption by
Gareth Corfield.

•  End-toEnd Encryption: The Good, the Bad and the Politics by Jay Thakkar

•  Topic 2: Should technology companies be allowed to see your data (e.g., Dropbox checking whether 
files

you store are illegal; or Apple checking whether your iPhone contains illegal materials)?

•  Here's Why Apple's New Child Safety Features Are So Controversial By Nilay Patel

•  Researchers Who Built Similar System Explain Why Apple's CSAM Scanning System Is Dangerous by 
Mike Masnick


Part 3: Conduct Formal Debate

• Use the following debate structure

• Affirmative Group presents their case to the audience (2 minutes)

• Negative Group presents their case to the audience (2 minutes)

• Break where Affirmative Group and Negative Group prepares a rebuttal and summary (2
minutes)

• Negative Group presents rebuttal and summary (2 minutes)

• Affirmative Group presents rebuttal and summary (2 minutes)

• Reflection with the whole class

Internet of Things (IoT)


Figure 1: lnternet of Things [1]


Definition

The Internet of Things (IoT)

Refers to the increasing number of everyday devices and objects that are connected
to the internet and are capable of gathering and transmitting data.


What Is the Internet of Things (IoT)

• Smart devices, gadgets, or machines gather information and communicate that data
via the Internet.

• Example: fitness tracker automatically sends activity data to an app on your phone.

• This is all possible because, these days, everything is getting smarter.

• Example: your phone can connect with many devices such as smart fridge and smart home
thermostats and can constantly gather and transmit data.


What Is the Internet of Things (IoT)

• The ability of machines to connect and share information is a key part of the IoT.

• It means that devices can talk to each other and potentially decide on a course of action without
human intervention.

• Example: manufacturing equipment fitted with sensors:

• Transmit performance data to the cloud for analysis.

• Based on that data, the system could automatically schedule the equipment for repair and
maintenance.


How Big Is the IoT?

• The IoT has experienced enormous growth in recent years and the popularity of
smart devices shows no sign of slowing down.

• In January 2019, Amazon sold more than 100 million smart devices with Alexa installed.

• by 2025, 75 billion devices will be connected to the internet (IHS prediction).

• As businesses understand the power of the IoT, expect many more exciting IoT-

related developments in the coming years.


IoT Architecture

IOT architecture consists of different technologies that are relate to each other and
to communicate the scalability, modularity and configuration of IOT deployments
in different scenarios. [1]

1- Smart device.

2- Sensor.

3- Gateways / Networks.

4- Environments or spaces in domains. Such as: Transportation, Building, City, Factory,

Healthcare etc.


IoT Applications

Figure 2: loT Applications


IoT Applications

1.  Making People Healthier with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)

• Helps monitor patients.

• Informs caregivers in the event of an emergency.

• Provide healthcare professionals with data that could inform diagnosis and ensure

patients follow doctors' orders.

• Example: IoMT devices can track heart performance, monitor glucose and other body

systems, and track activity and sleep levels.


IoT Applications

2.  Internet of Things in Business

• The biggest IoT opportunities lie in the ability to improve and optimize operations.

• Data generated from smart machines can be used to

• Improve the way the company is run.

• Potentially automate various processes.

• Reduce costs.

• Example: John Deere Company has developed intelligent farming solutions

• Sensors continuously monitor soil health and other factors

• Give farmers advice on what crops to plant where.


IoT Applications

3.  Introducing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

• Companies use IIoT to report every detail of operations of connected industrial devices on the
network.

• Example: Automobile parts manufacturer Hirotec used IIoT technology to monitor the
reliability and performance of machinery at one of its tool-building operations.

• This means the production of a complete auto component in a smart, connected way.


IoT Examples

• Google-owned Nest’s learning thermostat

• Tracks how you use your home so that it can regulate your home's temperature accordingly.

• The Orro intelligent light switch

• Knows when you are in the room and switch the lights on and off without you having to do 
anything.

• Adjust the lighting based on the time of day.

• The August Smart Lock Pro

• Locks and unlocks your home from anywhere, without a key.

• It automatically locks the house when you leave and unlocks it when you come home.

• Integrates with voice assistants like Alexa and Siri.


IoT Challenges

• Privacy

• Privacy is one of the concerns in IoT, as some devices are too smarter, more efficient and

smaller to detect. which affects the users' privacy, especially in home systems.

• companies looking to embed IoT technology in their products, workplaces, and equipment

should take privacy, ethics, and transparency seriously.


IoT Challenges

• Security

• The connectivity of IoT devices causes a dangerous side effect.

• A group of internet-connected devices are controlled by a central system that is usually

related to DDoS attacks.

• Could potentially leak your data and offer easy access points to anyone looking to steal it
with some devices that connect to the Internet.

• It is vital to take the necessary steps to secure your devices and data.

• Protecting devices with passwords

• Ensuring devices are up to date with the latest version of software routinely.


5G


Figure 4: Al enables intelligent 5G network management.

5G+AI: The ingredients fueling tomorrow’s tech innovations (qualcomm.com)


5G Definition

5G is the fifth generation of cellular network technology, which together with other
network innovations will give us much faster and more stable wireless networking,
as well as the ability to connect more and more devices and enable richer, more
varied streams of data.


What are 5G and Faster Smarter Networks?

• As the bandwidth and coverage have increased, more applications and services
have become possible.

• Example: email, web browsing, location-based services, and streaming video and games.

• Networks need to become smarter and faster, to handle the new paradigms they

will service.

• 5G networks must expand to cover consumers around the world. As well as
greatly increased speed.


What are 5G and Faster Smarter Networks?

• In traditional networks, large numbers of devices may all be connected through a

single router or network adapter, which makes speed slow.

• In 5G, the speeds are increasing, so networks getting smarter too. This means
networks where every node is connected to every other node, and they can
communicate directly.


How Edge Computing Could Benefit from 5G?

• IoT devices create masses of data, which can slow processing and decision-
making.

• 5G networking protocols can cope with connecting more devices with around 1
million devices packed into a 1km² in a geographical area.

• Edge Computing can benefit from 5G to handle critical data much more quickly:

• Less networks traffic congestion.

• Processing closer to the source of the data.


5G and Faster Smarter Networks Applications

• Enabling an Autonomous World

• Toyota has demonstrated the 1ˢᵗ 5G-enabled humanoid robot, T-HR3.

• 5G networks are an integral plans to roll out self-driving cars.

• In Germany, Thales and Vodaphone are carrying out the 1ˢᵗ trials of driveless
trains connected with 5G.


5G and Faster Smarter Networks Applications

• Smarter Networks

• Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a mobile networking

technology.

• NB-IoT has been developed to enable devices which can operate in very
remote conditions for lengthy periods without needing maintenance.

• NB-IoT has been put to use by Chinese farmers for monitoring and tracking

the location and health of their animals.


5G Challenges

• Current 5G networks often still rely on switching to data streams
carried by older Long-Term Evolution networks to carry out functions
such as authentication.

• It means that network speeds will inevitably be stalled by slowing.

• It will disappear as more networks are upgraded to full 5G capability.


5G Challenges

• For many organizations, a decision that will need to be taken soon is whether to
rely on 5G or existing wi-fi networks for high-speed, local networking.

• Early experiences of 5G have shown that the signals are more prone to disruption

from physical infrastructure than existing technology.

• Example: tall buildings, or simply being inside


Conclusion

• The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming our physical world into a complex
and dynamic system of connected devices on an unprecedented scale.

• Devices like autonomous vehicles or smart trains generate billions of data points
every day, which in turn power AI systems to optimize system performance, route
planning, etc.


Conclusion

• 5G will bring much faster wireless broadband speeds to devices like smartphones

and IoT systems.

• In 5G will drastically accelerate edge computing, the marriage of data collection
and computation on the billions of devices

• Example: the small devices inside factory buildings, homes, and vehicles.

What is Extended Reality (XR) ?


Extended Reality (XR)

Is an umbrella term that encompasses any sort of technology that alters
reality by adding digital elements to the physical or real-world
environment by any extent, blurring the line between the physical and
the  digital world.

• XR encompasses virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality –
refers to the use of technology to create more immersive digital
experience.


Extended Reality (XR)

• XR refers to the use of technology to create more immersive digital experience.

• There are three different types of XR

• Virtual reality (VR)

• Augmented reality (AR)

• Mixed reality (MR)


Virtual Reality (VR)

• VR means using computer technology to fully immerse the user in a simulated
digital environment, to the extent that they feel like they're physically in that
environment.

• VR typically works via special headsets or glasses, like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or

Samsung Gear VR headsets .

• VR technology has advanced enormously in recent years and can now offer
incredibly realistic digital experiences, such as walking on the moon, or wandering
around eighteenth-century Venice.


Application of virtual reality (VR)

• Virtual Reality enjoys great popularity especially in the field of video games.

Nevertheless, VR offers many other possible applications:

• In the military, this technology is used in flight simulators or battlefield simulations.

• In sports, digital training devices help athletes improve their own performance and analyze
their techniques

• In medicine, VR can be used for post-traumatic stress or anxiety. At the same time, the

technology allows trainee doctors to train surgical techniques.

15


Augmented Reality (AR)

• AR is rooted in the real world, not a simulated digital environment. With AR, information

or images can be overlaid onto what the user is seeing in the real world.

• Example: the popular Pokemon GO game, where users could “see” Pokemon characters on the
street via their smart phone.

• AR can be delivered via smart phones, smart glasses, tablets, web interfaces, smart
screens, or smart mirrors.

• Because AR is rooted in the real world, the experience is less immersive than VR but
offers amazing opportunities to augment the world we see around us.


Applications of Augmented Reality

• Augmented reality offers a wide range of possibilities. This makes it
interesting for both private and business users. Special apps can embed
images, text or videos.

• Use in printing and advertising industry.

• Use to translate texts into other languages

• Use in construction and logistics - to increase the efficiency of employees and the
business processes.

• Get in touch with customers, colleagues or technicians.

17


Mixed Reality (MR)

• MR is an extension of AR that brings the virtual and real worlds together, creating a more 
connected

experience in which the virtual and real elements can interact.

• With AR, users can't interact with the information or objects being overlaid onto the real

environment; with MR, they can.

• The user can play around with virtual elements like they would in the real world, and the 3D 
digital

content responds and reacts accordingly.

• Example: using gestures, you could physically turn an object around to inspect it from all 
angles.

• For MR to work, the user has to have an MR device, like Microsoft's HoloLens, which, among other

things, turns apps into holograms that the user can touch and move around.


How Are Digitally Extended Realities Used


How Are Digitally Extended Realities Used

• The worlds of gaming and entertainment were obvious early adopters, but XR
technology is now being used in a range of industries and organizations – from
training surgeons and soldiers, to selling the latest luxury vehicles.

• Of the three XR technologies, MR is the newest and therefore the least widely
developed, so the following examples naturally focus more on VR and AR.


How Are Digitally Extended Realities Used

1.  Boosting Brand Engagement

Thanks to XR, brands are able to design fun, novel experiences that help to create a buzz around
their brand.

• Example: Pepsi created an incredible AR-enabled display in a London bus shelter, which stunned
commuters by overlaying eye-popping images onto the real-life street in front of them. These
images included a meteor crashing into the ground, a tiger padding towards them, and a large
tentacle popping up from underneath the paving slabs!

• https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB_qT6rAPyY 


How Are Digitally Extended Realities Used

2. Letting Customers Try Before They Buy

With AR, customers can try a product or get to know a brand's product range from the comfort of

their own home.

• Example: Tenth Street Hats offers an AR solution that lets customers try on hats at home. Users
can see how different hats look on their head at any angle and take pictures of themselves
wearing the hat.


How Are Digitally Extended Realities Used

3. Enhancing Customer Service

Finding ways to make customers' lives easier gets a whole lot more interesting when you add VR

and AR into the mix.

• Example: The passenger app for London's Gatwick Airport has won awards for its creative use
of AR technology. Passengers can use the app to navigate through the busy airport.


How Are Digitally Extended Realities Used

4. Making Workplace Learning More Effective

XR offers new ways to immerse employees in a situation, thereby enhancing the learning
experience.

• Example: The US Army is harnessing AR to improve soldiers' situational awareness, using an
eyepiece that helps them precisely locate their position, locate others around them, and identify
whether they're a friend or a foe.


How Are Digitally Extended Realities Used

5. Improving Other Organizational Processes

Although most of the industry use cases focus around marketing and training, VR, MR, and AR 
technology is
helping to enhance a wide range of other processes and functions.

• Example: Facial recognition technology is being increasingly used by law enforcement agencies
around the world. And when coupled with AR eyewear, officers can cross reference faces in a
crowd to identify criminals in real time.


Activity 1: Exploring XR Applications

Activity 2: Google Cardboard


Activity: Google Cardboard

• Google Cardboard was developed in 2014 as a fold-out viewer made of cardboard into which a 
smartphone can
be inserted. It is a low-cost system designed to encourage interest and development in VR 
applications. This
activity allows for students to 1) build a viewer (or use one pre-purchased by the teaching team), 
and 2) take a
VR field trip using the viewer.

Part 1: Build Viewer

Divide students into teams to build their own viewer from simple, low-cost components: cardboard, 
lenses,
magnets, hook and loop fastener and a rubber band. Specifications and instructions have been 
provided by Google
as a zip file here .

Note: When building the viewer, make sure the viewer fits the phone screen size of a smartphone.


Activity: Google Cardboard

Part 2: Virtual Field Trip

From exploring famous cities to exploring the solar system, there are many experiences that 
students can have with the viewer.

To use the viewer, students need to place a smartphone into the back of the viewer, and then view 
content through the lenses.

Compatible mobile apps require Android 4.1+ or recent iOS smartphones.

Allow students to take a virtual field trip and have interactive experiences through one or more of 
these options:

● Watch 360-degree videos on YouTube here

● Download the official Cardboard app on Android here or iOS here , and encounter VR experiences 
through the Cardboard app.

● Search for “cardboard app” in the Google Play Store here, download a viewer-compatible app, and 
encounter VR experiences
through the downloaded app.


Key Challenges


Key Challenges

The biggest challenges for those wanting to adopt XR technology:

• Accessibility and availability

• Privacy

• Potential mental and physical impact of highly immersive technologies.


Conclusion

• XR is an emerging umbrella for all the immersive technologies. The ones we already
have today—augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR)
plus those that are still to be created. All immersive technologies extend the reality
we experience by either blending the virtual and “real” worlds or by creating a fully
immersive experience.

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

• Artificial intelligence (AI) is a large subject of computer science devoted to the
development of intelligent computers capable of doing tasks that would typically need
human intelligence.

• AI programming focuses on three cognitive processes: learning, reasoning, and self
correction.

• Machine learning, the most popular subset of AI technology, can make sense of all the data
that online stores collect and use it to provide insights that improve customer experience,
streamline internal business operations, and combat fraud.


What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-
controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent
beings.


What Is Intelligence?

• All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while
even  the  most  complicated insect behavior  is  never  taken  as  an
indication of intelligence.


Why Is Artificial Intelligence Important?

• AI is important because it forms the very foundation of computer
learning.

• Computers could harness massive amounts of data

• Use their learned intelligence to make optimal decisions and discoveries in
fractions of the time that it would take humans.


Types of Artificial Intelligence

• weak AI:— also called Narrow AI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

• AI trained and focused to perform specific tasks.

• Drives most of the AI that surrounds us today.

• strong AI: — is made up of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial
Super Intelligence (ASI).

• (AGI), or general AI is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would have an intelligence
equaled to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that could solve problems, learn,
and plan.


Deep learning vs Machine learning

• Deep learning (DL) is comprised of neural networks. “Deep” in deep learning
refers to a neural network comprised of more than three layers—which would be
inclusive of the inputs and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm.

• Machine learning (ML ) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building
methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on
some set of tasks.


What Are Their Differences & Impacts?


Deep Learning Example

• A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive

of the inputs and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm.


Type of Machine Learning


Machine learning involves showing a large
volume of data to a machine so that it can learn
and make predictions, find patterns, or classify
data.

Learning


Supervised Machine Learning

• Supervised Machine Learning: is based on supervision.

• The machines are trained using the "labelled" dataset, and based on the training, the machine
predicts the output.

• Goal: to map the input variable( x ) with the output variable( y ).

• real-world applications: Risk Assessment, Fraud Detection, Spam filtering, etc.

• Can be classified into two types of problems:

• Classification

• Regression


Supervised Machine Learning

• Classification algorithms are used to solve the classification problems in which the output
variable is categorical, such as "Yes" or No, Male or Female, Red or Blue, etc .

• Goal: Predict the categories present in the dataset.

• Real-world examples: Spam Detection, Email filtering, etc.

• Regression

• used to solve regression problems in which there is a linear relationship between input and output
variables.

• These are used to predict continuous output variables, such as market trends, weather prediction, 
etc.


Supervised Machine Learning

Advantages

• We can have an exact idea about the classes of objects since supervised learning work with the

labelled dataset so .

• Predicting the output based on prior experience.

Disadvantages

• Not able to solve complex tasks.

• May predict the wrong output if the test data is different from the training data.

• Requires lots of computational time to train the algorithm.


Unsupervised Machine Learning

• Unsupervised Machine Learning

• The machine is trained using the unlabeled dataset, and the machine predicts the output without
any supervision.

• Goal - To group or categorize the unsorted dataset according to the similarities, patterns, and

differences.

•  Machines are instructed to find the hidden patterns from the input dataset.

• Can be classified into two types:

• Clustering

• Association


Unsupervised Machine Learning

• Clustering

• Find the inherent groups from the data. It is a way to group the objects into a cluster such that 
the objects with
the most similarities remain in one group and have fewer or no similarities with the objects of 
other groups.

• Popular clustering algorithms

• K-Means Clustering algorithm

• Mean-shift algorithm

• DBSCAN Algorithm

• Principal Component Analysis

• Independent Component Analysis


Unsupervised Machine Learning

• Association

• Finds interesting relations among variables within a large dataset.

• Goal: find the dependency of one data item on another data item and map those
variables accordingly so that it can generate maximum profit.

• Popular Association algorithms

• Apriori Algorithm

• Eclat algorithm

• FP-growth algorithm


Unsupervised Machine Learning

• Advantages

• Can be used for complicated tasks compared to the supervised ones because these algorithms
work on the unlabeled dataset.

• Preferable for various tasks as getting the unlabeled dataset is easier as compared to the 
labelled
dataset.

• Disadvantages

• The output can be less accurate as the dataset is not labelled, and algorithms are not trained 
with

the exact output in prior.

• Working with Unsupervised learning is more difficult as it works with the unlabeled dataset that

does not map with the output.


Semi-Supervised Learning

• Semi-Supervised learning - lies between Supervised and Unsupervised machine
learning.

• The main aim of semi-supervised learning is to effectively use all the available data,
rather than only labelled data like in supervised learning.


Semi-Supervised Learning

• Advantages

• It is simple and easy to understand the algorithm.

• It is highly efficient.

• It is used to solve drawbacks of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning algorithms.

• Disadvantages

• Iterations results may not be stable.

• We cannot apply these algorithms to network-level data.

• Accuracy is low.


Reinforcement Learning

• Reinforcement learning works on a feedback-based process, in which an AI agent
automatically explore its surrounding by hitting & trail, acting, learning from experiences,
and improving its performance.

• Categorized into two types of methods/algorithms

• Positive Reinforcement Learning specifies increasing the tendency that the required behavior would
occur again by adding something. It enhances the strength of the behavior of the agent and 
positively
impacts it.

• Negative Reinforcement Learning works exactly opposite to the positive RL. It increases the 
tendency
that the specific behavior would occur again by avoiding the negative condition.


Reinforcement Learning

• Advantages

• Helps in solving complex real-world problems which are difficult to be solved by general
techniques.

• Similar to the learning of human beings; hence most accurate results can be found.

• Helps in achieving long term results.

• Disadvantage

• Not preferred for simple problems.

• Require huge data and computations.

• Too much reinforcement learning can lead to an overload of states which can weaken the results.


The Application of Artificial intelligence

• The Application of Artificial intelligence is a part of computer science
that  studied  the  computational  need  for  tasks  such  as  reasoning,
perception, learning and developed systems to perform those task.


The Application of Artificial intelligence

to make it.


The Future of AI?

Future prospects and applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, 
including

• Autonomous Vehicles - Many types of sensor and vision data (cameras, Lidar, GPS, etc.), but still

challenging to achieve human-like driving performance, especially when other drivers are on the 
road.

• Smart Cities - Traffic light cameras could help give route suggestions to reduce traffic 
congestion;
measuring building energy usage can help the grid operate more efficiently; measuring weather data 
can
guide placement of wind turbines and solar panels.

• Creative Endeavors - Deep learning models can generate art, text, music, etc., which can be 
subsequently

polished by humans; style transfer, autotune, etc. Frame learning/AI models as tools that can be 
used hand-in

-hand with human creativity.


The Future of AI?

• OpenAI – creating artificial general intelligence (AGI).

• goal of AGI – to create an AI system that's as generally intelligent and flexible as

the human brain


Key Challenges

• Regulation

• Provide clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI.

• Privacy Concerns

• Gain consent before using users' data for AI applications

• Lack of Explainability

•  “blackbox problem” –can't always tell how very complex AI systems arrive at their decisions.

• Data Issues

•  Biases in training data can create biased learning models; e.g., having millions of images of 
dogs but only hundreds of images of
cats, can make a model more likely to classify cat images as dogs

• The AI Skills Gap

• shortage of people who can develop complex AI systems


Discussion - Study Questions

• What are the risks of artificial intelligence?

• What are the opportunities of artificial intelligence?

• Can AI be more intelligent than humans?

• What are the best artificial intelligence algorithms that use with ML and DL?


Conclusion

• Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): an intelligent agent can understand or learn
any intellectual task that a human being can.

• Learning models still do not necessarily "understand“ in the way humans do; certain
problems like autonomous driving require inordinate amounts of data, yet still do not
perform as well as we'd hope;

• Many ethics and privacy questions around learning are ongoing.

Study Questions

• Why do you think robotics, drones, and autonomous vehicles might be beneficial? What do you
think are some common themes and challenges facing this technology?

• As robotics technologies grow and mature, and the definition of robotics is broad and only 
getting

broader, how should we define the sector? Do we include autonomous driving, for example?

• Would you trust a robot to clean your room? Cut your hair? Do dental work? Do a medical
intervention (e.g., arthroscopic knee surgery)? Would you fly in a plane assembled entirely by
robots? Why? Why not?

• If you were going to create a robotics startup, what area or application of robotics would you 
focus
on, and why?

• What are delivery and navigation challenges for drones?


Robotics


What Are Robots?

• Robotic process automation (RPA) is technology that can automate business

processes that are rules based, structured, and repetitive

• Today's robots can be defined as intelligent machines that can understand and
respond  to their environment and perform routine or complex tasks
autonomously

• It is the intelligence and ability to act autonomously that define robots and
separate them from other machines


What Are Robots?

• Robots are now commonplace in sectors like car manufacturing, but
they are starting to make their move into other sectors

• According to one estimate, up to 35% of organizations in health,
utilities, and logistics are exploring the use of automated robots


Robots

• Robots have become more advanced, with greater intelligence and more
automation. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), sensors and the IoT, and big
data.

• Today's robots are not only physically more robust and flexible than early

industrial robots, but they are also real so much smarter.

• We have delivery robots, robots that can perform surgery, robots for space
exploration, demolition robots, under water robots, search-and-rescue robots,
and more.


Real-Life Examples of Robots

• Some exciting real-life examples of robots in a variety of settings

• Delivery Robots

• Robots for Safety and Security

• Robots in Healthcare

• Robots in the Home

• Humanoid Robots

• Robots Building Other Robots


Drones


What Are Drones?

• Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs ), are aircraft
that are piloted either remotely or autonomously

• Drones take many forms, from the small, inexpensive drones flown by
enthusiastic hobbyists, to the multimillion-dollar military drones that have
become a critical part of missions


What Are Drones?

• Drone technology is continually evolving, and the cutting edge involves
developing autonomous drones that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI).

• Drone is equipped with technology like:

• GPS sensors

• Gyroscopes

• Accelerometers

• Infrared cameras

• First-person view cameras

• Lasers


Different Modalities of Drones

• Drones are technically quadcopters, meaning they have four rotors, can take off
and land vertically, and hover so, they are more like a helicopter than a plane

• Heavy duty military drones, on the other hand, tend to resemble small planes, in
that they have fixed wings and require a runway to take off and land


Drone Features

• Drones typically come with a “return to home” feature, whereby if a drone
loses contact with its controller or is low on battery, it will automatically
return to its home point.

• The latest drones also come with systems that can detect and avoid obstacles
while in flight.

• Many drones are also being fitted with a “no fly zone” feature to prevent them
flying into restricted areas.


Real-World Examples of Drones

• Drones have so many potential uses, and the technology will transform how goods

are delivered, and ultimately, perhaps even transform how humans travel.

• Some real-world examples of drones in action.

• Military Drones

• Search and Rescue and Firefighting Drones

• Drones for Law Enforcement

• Delivery Drones

• Industry Examples of Drones

• Passenger Drones


Key Challenges

• Concerns around military use of autonomous drones

• e.g., Should we even want to develop drone swarms that can make tactical decisions for
themselves?

• A number of leading AI and robotics experts have signed an open letter calling for a ban on

autonomous weapons, including autonomous drones.

• Concerns around security

• Specifically, the possibility that drones could be hacked.

• Protecting drones from such attacks will become even more important, particularly for military
drones that can deploy weapons.


Key Challenges

• Decisions need to be made regarding air space, and how all these drones will interact
with other drones

• e.g., whether passenger drones need to be able to communicate with delivery drones.

• Noise pollution and privacy

• Since drones are basically noisy, flying computers with cameras.

• If delivery drones become the norm for certain goods, that will significantly impact
the work of drivers.


Autonomous

Vehicles


Autonomous Vehicles

• An autonomous vehicle is one that can sense what is going on

around it and operate without human involvement

• Autonomous Vehicle Examples

• Car

• Truck

• Ship

• Another vehicle


How Do Self-Driving Cars Work?

• It requires a lot of advanced technology to enable autonomous cars to understand
what is going on around them and decide what to do in response.

• Thanks to sensors and computer vision technology.

• AI and big data also play a critical role.

• When it comes to sensors

• radar is used to detect objects, including their size and speed.

• Lidar (light imaging detection and ranging) may also be used to map the car's
surroundings.

• It is similar to radar but uses laser light pulses instead of radio waves.


How Do Self-Driving Cars Work?

• Self-driving cars are fitted with cameras for providing an accurate view of the car's
surroundings.

• Read road signs.

• Recognize road markings.

• Together, these technologies help the vehicle

• Scan and map its surroundings.

• Navigate a route.

• Carry out maneuvers.

• Avoid obstacles.


Overview of the 5 Levels of Autonomy

• Autonomy in vehicles is classified according to the following:

• Level 1 Basic driver support features that can provide steering or brake/acceleration

support. So, essentially, only one driver process at a time is automated.

• Such as lane centering or adaptive cruise control.

• Level 2 Still focused on driver support as opposed to automation, cars at this level can
provide steering and brake/ acceleration support at the same time.

• A self-parking feature would fall under level 2 autonomy


Overview of the 5 Levels of Autonomy

• Level 3 Now we move into automated drive features that can drive the vehicle under
limited conditions. At this level, the car is capable of driving itself but, crucially, the
driver must be ready to take the wheel when the system requests.

• A traffic jam chauffeur feature is a good example of level 3 autonomy

• Level 4 the vehicle will not require a human to take over, and it may not even be fitted
with pedals or a steering wheel. However, can still only operate under certain conditions

• One example being a local driverless taxi that can only operate in a limited zone


Overview of the 5 Levels of Autonomy

• Level 5 This offers the same level of autonomy as level 4, in that a
human is not needed to take over. However, what separates level 5 from
level 4 is that the autonomous features can drive the vehicle anywhere
and under all conditions.


Advantages to Self-Driving

There are many advantages to self-driving cars taking to the road.

• Being improved road safety

• Driver error is by far the biggest cause of road traffic accidents, due to factors like:

• Miscalculations.

• Errors of judgment.

• Speeding.

• Drink-driving.

• Phone use.

• When applied to public transport, autonomous vehicle technology could help authorities run more 
efficient transport networks.

• Autonomous vehicles will improve parking in congested cities

• Driverless vehicles will simply drop passengers off and move on.


Smart Cities and Autonomous Vehicles

• All things considered, self-driving vehicles could change the face of our cities

• Congestion and pollution will decrease (self-driving vehicles will be electric or hybrids)

• And land that is currently used for huge car parks could be repurposed for housing or public
spaces

• Developers can build properties with fewer parking spaces so long as they provide suitable curb-
side passenger loading zones

• The autonomous vehicles of the future will drastically improve the daily commute, especially when
we reach the point where human intervention is never needed


Real-World Examples of Autonomous

Vehicles

• Examples of different types of vehicles (not just cars) when they are becoming
increasingly automated, and what we can expect of the self-driving vehicles of the
future.

• Self-Driving Cars

• Autonomous Taxis and Public Transport

• Self-Driving Trucks and Vans

• Self-Driving Bikes and Scooters

• Autonomous Ships


Key Challenges

• Major legal obstacles

• The legal framework is not in place to govern autonomous vehicles on the road, leaving many
critical things open to interpretation, leaving many critical things open to interpretation.

• e.g., Who is responsible if a fully autonomous, driverless vehicle is involved in an accident?

• Technological challenges to overcome before we can reach full level 5 autonomy.

• Even the most advanced driver assistance features on the market today can incorrectly interpret
their environment every now and then.


Key Challenges

• Security

• Specifically, the concern that vehicles could be hacked.

• Increasing automation will inevitably lead to job losses

• Lorry drivers, taxi drivers, public transport drivers, and couriers are most at risk of losing 
their
jobs to the autonomous vehicles of the future.


Conclusion

• Robotic is technology that can automate business processes that are rules based, structured,
and repetitive.

• Drones have so many potential uses. And its technology will transform how goods are

delivered, and, ultimately, perhaps event transform how humans travel.

• An autonomous vehicles is one that can sense what is going on around it and operate
without human involvement.

Manufacturing


Traditional manufacturing VS Additive

Manufacturing

Traditional manufacturing processes.

• Casting - usually involves liquid material poured into a mold, and then, that is allowed to 
solidify.
Also can be by removing parts of a block of material in order to create the desired shape. E.g.
Cutting wood into useful shapes.

Mold                   Computer numerical control, (CNC Machine),


Traditional manufacturing VS Additive

Manufacturing

• 3D printing (also known as additive manufacturing) means creating a 3D object
from a digital file by building it layer by layer; 4D printing is based on the same
process but with a twist – namely, a built-in ability for the printed object to
transform itself.

• Additive manufacturing has been called a disruptive technology that will
fundamentally influence many processes in production , supply chain design,
logistics , product life-cycle planning, and also consumer behavior.


Traditional manufacturing VS Additive

Manufacturing

• The two images shows how additive manufacturing operates by adding layers of material
together to make an object.


Characteristics of Additive Manufacturing


Characteristics of Additive Manufacturing

•  Enabling direct production of physical objects from digital design data, which also
provides new opportunities for freedom of design. Additionally, customized products can
be manufactured without the high surpluses conventionally connected with one-of-a-kind
manufacturing

•  On the consumer side, additive manufacturing allows private and industrial users to
design and produce their own goods, enhancing idea of the rise of the ‘prosumer'.

[1] Predicting the future of additive manufacturing: A Delphi study on economic and societal

implications of 3D printing for 2030 by Ruth Jiang a,x, Robin Kleer a,b, Frank T. Piller a


Future of Additive Manufacturing

• The diagram illustrates the most probable future projections that affect how the AM products will 
be
developed, distributed and how the perception of the products will be changed in the consumers 
side.


Future of Additive Manufacturing

Projection 9: Product Development

In 2030, conventional measures of “time to market”, “product life cycle” and “ramp-up” will
have diminished as digital products will be in a continuous beta stage and be subjected to
frequent design iterations and constant modifications.

Product development changes from traditional stage-gate models to iterative, agile processes
where conventional measures such as time-to-market or time-to-ramp-up have partly become
obsolete


Future of Additive Manufacturing

Projection 14: Multi-materials Embedded Electronics

• In 2030, a significant amount of additive manufacturing-produced products will consist of
multi-materials and/or contain embedded electronics, enabling a broad range of applications.

• The scope of products printable via additive manufacturing will be much larger, as
multi-material additive manufacturing production and embedded electronics will be
possible to a large extent.


Future of Additive Manufacturing

Projection 5: Spare Parts Manufacturing

• In 2030, manufacturing of spare parts will be divided into two systems: less critical parts
will be produced locally via additive manufacturing, whereas critical parts will be made at
specialist hubs with specific qualification/quality control skills, primarily using conventional
manufacturing techniques.


Future of Additive Manufacturing

Projection 12 & 17: Product Design Databases

In 2030, a significant number of consumers will utilize online databases (repositories) to
purchase product designs or to access open-source designs freely for additive manufacturing
printing purposes.

At the same time, regulatory measures for additive manufacturing file-sharing
platforms will become important. Governments are expected to engage in regulating
such platforms, even though the experts think that “controlling infringement by
outlawing it won't be effective (see the music industry)”


Future of Additive Manufacturing

Projection 16: intellectual property

• In 2030, the difficulty of defending conventional intellectual property for digital products will 
lead to a
significantly larger use of novel forms of intellectual property like Creative Commons, or open 
source.

•  Experts believe that there will be a significantly larger use of novel forms of intellectual 
property like Creative
Commons or open source (hardware) licenses, as these are “necessary and an enabler for the digital
manufacturing community”

•  Also, complementary measures for protecting intellectual property will become necessary: “I feel 
that
intellectual property protection will be less critical compared with the ability to being quickest 
to market”

•  The “control of usage information will be important for digital products. The combination of 
design and use will
become the basis for defending intellectual property” . “This will move in the same direction as 
copyright for
music and films etc. New models need to be developed”.

Security Implication of Current 3D Printing

Capabilities

• ‘Liberator' first functional 3D-printed plastic gun.

• Is it dangerous?

•  The performance of the gun depended heavily on the plastic used
in the creation.

• Attempts at making printed bullet have taken place but these perform
very poorly

•  US Company Solid Concepts released a video that showed the first 3D
metal-printed gun

•  In terms of metal 3D printing the technology is still very expensive and
thus not accessible to the average person, and nearly impossible to
acquire for an armed group in a third world country.


Security Implication of Current 3D Printing

Capabilities

• The ability to produce a gun using 3D printing technology is assisted by three
factors:

• Individuals interested in designing and developing better gun models.

• The advances in chemistry will lead to stronger plastics

• Advances in 3D printers themselves


Key Challenges


Key Challenges

• Environmental Empact

•  Even though 3D printing tends to rely on plastic and use produced less waste.
However perhaps the main concern is that 3D printers use a lot of energy –
potentially hundreds of times more energy than traditional methods


Key Challenges

• Intellectual Property

• 3D printing Enables counterfeiters to produce fake licensed goods cheaply and easily.

• Security and Safety

• Weapons can be easily 3D printed .

• Potential to cause injuries and health problems to workers by the direct exposure
to ultrafine metal and other particles created during the additive manufacturing
process

Distributed Ledger


What is Distributed Ledger Technology?

• DLT refers to a novel and fast-evolving approach to recording and sharing

data across multiple data stores (or ledgers).

• This technology allows for transactions and data to be recorded, shared, and
synchronized across a distributed network of different network participants.


Distributed Ledgers - Architecture

• Distributed Ledgers are designed as a peer-to-peer distributed system composed by a
number of nodes. Each node propagates transactions and ledger updates to all other
nodes and fulfils one or more of the below roles:

•  Participant: responsible for transactions input. Depending on the implementation,
have the option to either store the full copy of the ledger or not. Wallet in Bitcoin
terminology.

•  Validator: Verify transactions and update the ledger. Miner in Bitcoin terminology.


Centralized Ledger

There are multiple ledgers, but Bank holds the
“golden record”.

Client B must reconcile its own ledger against that
of Bank, and must convince Bank of the “true state”
of the Bank ledger if discrepancies arise


Distributed Ledger

There is one ledger. All Nodes have some level of

access to that ledger.

• All Nodes agree to a protocol that determines the
“true state” of the ledger at any point in time. The
application of this protocol is sometimes called
“achieving consensus.”


What is Distributed Ledger?

Single Entity             Multiple Entities


How Might A Distributed Ledger Work?


The Power of Distributed Ledgers

• It can be used without a central authority by individuals or entities with
no basis to trust each other

• It can be used to create value or issue assets.

• It can be used to transfer value or the ownership of assets (A human

being or a Smart Contract can initiate the transfer)


The Power of Distributed Ledgers

• It can be used to record those transfers of value or ownership of assets
(These records may be very difficult to alter, such that they are sometimes
called effectively immutable)

• It can be used to allow owners of assets to exercise certain rights associated
with ownership, and to record the exercise of those rights.

Discussion - Study Questions

• Instructions

• Form a group of 3-4 students,

• Discuss study questions – 5 minutes

• Group leader can share ideas/ results of the discussion


Study Questions

• Name the common type of ledgers that can be considered by users in Blockchain?

• How is a blockchain ledger different from an ordinary one?

• The common types of records (to name a few) that can be kept on the Blockchains are?

• A distributed digital ledger is used for recording transaction in Blockchain. What does

the system rely on?

• Can You explain the components of Blockchain Ecosystem?


What does “Blockchain” mean?

• To understand the power of blockchain systems, and the things they can do, it is important to
distinguish between three things that are commonly muddled up, namely the bitcoin currency, the
specific blockchain that underpins it and the idea of blockchains in general.

• A ‘blockchain’ is a particular type of data structure used in some distributed ledgers which 
stores and
transmits data in packages called ‘blocks’ that are connected to each other in a digital ‘chain’.
Blockchains employ cryptographic and algorithmic methods to record and synchronize data across a
network in an immutable manner.


Why blockchain is important:

• Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is,

the better.

• Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate,
shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that
can be accessed only by permissioned network members.

• A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much

more.


How Does Blockchain-Based DLT Work?


Benefits of blockchain

• What needs to change: Operations often waste effort on duplicate record keeping
and third-party validations.

Greater trust

• With blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest assured that
you are receiving accurate and timely data, and that your confidential blockchain
records will be shared only with network members to whom you have specifically
granted access.


Benefits of blockchain

Greater security

• Consensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and all validated transactions
are immutable because they are recorded permanently. No one, not even a system administrator,
can delete a transaction.

More efficiencies

• With a distributed ledger that is shared among members of a network, time-wasting record

reconciliations are eliminated. And to speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract

— can be stored on the blockchain and executed automatically.


Blockchain

A technology that permits transactions to be gathered into blocks and recorded;
cryptographically chains blocks in chronological order; and allows the resulting

ledger to be accessed by different servers.


Where Might Blockchain Use Cryptography?

Initiation and Broadcasting of Transaction

• Digital Signatures

• Private/Public Keys

Validation of Transaction

• Proof of Work and certain alternatives

Chaining Blocks

• Hash Function


Cryptographic Hash Functions & Digital Signatures

• Cryptography is at the core of DLT, in particular for
blockchain implementations. Each new data entry, i.e.,
a transaction record, is “hashed”, which means that a
cryptographic hash function is applied to the original
message.

• A hash takes data of any size input and computes a
digital fingerprint similar to a human fingerprint that
cannot be changed unless the data itself is changed.


Blockchain Structure

• blockchain structure: The last block (block 5) was added to an
existing blockchain (blocks 1-4, block 1 being the ‘genesis block’).

• Each block contains a unique “proof- of-work” protocol, a reference
to the previous block that determines the correct chronological
ordering of blocks, a series of hashed digests of transaction
information which cannot be changed, and a digital signature.

• In this figure, block 5 represents the newest addition to this

blockchain which updates the ledger.


Types of blockchain

There mainly three types of Blockchains that have emerged after Bitcoin introduced Blockchain to 
the world.

Public Blockchain

no one in charge, anyone can participate in reading/writing/auditing the blockchain (i.e. Bitcoin, 
Litecoin, etc.)

Private Blockchain

a private property of an individual or an organization, there is one in charge of important things 
such as read/write or whom to

selectively give access to read or vice versa (i.e. Blockchain)

Consortium or Federated Blockchain

More than one in charge. A group of companies or representative individuals come together and make 
decisions for the best benefit of

the whole network


Blockchain terminologies

● Bitcoin

o Crypto currency, first asset based on Blockchain

o Used for drug/weapons e-commerce, ransom ware

o Used for remittance, speculation, store of value

• “What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a
trusted third party.”

Key Challenges

Hardware and Energy Consumption for Blockchain Applications Are a Major Challenge :

• Blockchain is used widely on the Internet for a variety of purposes. Due to its
decentralized nature can be viewed as a viable alternative to many traditional transaction
systems. Blockchain systems must be offloaded to an accelerating system for scalability,
interoperability, and sustainability (scalability, interoperability, and sustainability).

• Public key operations such as signature generation and verification can be offloaded as one
of the solutions, a secure public key infrastructure engine.


Key Challenges

Scalability:

• Blockchain networks can handle a high number of transactions on large-scale
blockchain applications. Data processing services are essential for scalable
blockchain services because high transaction execution requires sophisticated data
processing services.


Key Challenges

• Many blockchains struggle to support countless users on that machine. Because of a large increase 
in
clients, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the major blockchain systems, experienced modest exchange rates and
higher exchange fees.

• Although this reality has prompted topto-bottom research about making both these systems and
blockchains more proportional, the discussion around the recommendations is exceptionally
changed. It is likely to take a long time to conclude. In addition, scaling techniques should be
verified and thoroughly tested before being applied to a record.


Key Benefits

• Reduced costs – by reducing or eliminating the need for “middleman” services,
blockchain promises to remove the financial burdens involved in making and
recording transactions.

• Increased traceability – because every point of a supply chain could in theory be
reliably recorded in a blockchain.

• Enhanced security – thanks to blockchain’s encryption, handling and securing
sensitive data is likely to become a lot easier.


Conclusion

•  A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record 
transactions across
many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all 
subsequent
blocks and the consensus of the network.

• A further challenge, particularly relevant for the area of financial markets infrastructures, are 
the substantial
costs related to migrating existing longstanding IT systems, operational arrangements, and 
institutional
frameworks to DLT- based infrastructure

•  Distributed ledger systems can be open/permissionless or permissioned, and there are fundamental 
differences
between these two types, which lead to very different risk profiles.
